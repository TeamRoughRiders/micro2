Micro2  - LAB 3  Instructions and Materials:


NOTE: All the required hardware components are provided by the TA of Micro2 Ioannis Smanis

Required Materials for lab 3: 
 1x Temperature sensor (for Undergrad teams)
 1x Gesture Sensor (for Grad teams)
 1x Galileo Board + wi-fi cards 
 2x Wi-Fi antennas 
 1x Usb Web camera
 1x FTDI Cable 


---------  Device Characteristics:
*********************************************
Temperature sensor : Texas Instruments TMP102 
Power Supply: 3.3V MAX (Please do not exceed this limit)
Interface: I2C  (3.3V tolerance)
Device Address:  (Default Address 0x48) To change the default I2C address use the instructions included in the schematics

PIN OUT:
SDA: I2C Data  Line  (3.3V tolerance)
SCL: I2C Clock Line  (3.3V tolerance)
VCC: 3.3V
GND: Ground

Hooking up Temperature Sensor on Galileo Board: there is no need for pull-up resistors on the I2C lines 
For your Interest : This sensor is used for Samsung Galaxy S5 in order to support all the smart scroll/swipe gestures

http://i-am-gabi.github.io/take-a-picture-opencv-galileo  (useful for debugging your camera - in Pyhton (Python code is not acceptable as Lab3 deliverables )

NOTE: You need to use modules such as OpenCV in order to handle the camera which is embedded in the new yocto image

step 1. boot your yocto OS on your Galileo board 
step 2. connect your given web camera to the USB Host port on the Galileo
step 3. use ssh client via network or USB-to-Serial cable to manage your Galileo board
step 4. check if your camera is connected to your Galileo board: browse to the "/dev" directory and type "ls" to see the device list of your board. You should see a device called "video0"
step 5. develop your own .cpp or .c file or project in C/C++ language for taking pictures and video using the web camera and the given I2C Sensor device (Temperature or Gesture sensor) as the trigger for the camera. Be creative and make your own scenario to trigger your camera using the given sensor.
